</ul>
<ol start="3">

<ol start="4">

<h1 id="how-to-know-if-a-user-story-is-ready">How to know if a user story is ready?</h1>
<p>A complete user story should be clear, feasible and testable</p>
<p><em>Clear</em>: It includes what is needed by the user</p>
<p><em>Feasible</em>: It should not be too big and can fit in a sprint</p>
<p><em>Testable</em>: A confirmation can be provided post story completion about the correctness of the user story</p>

<li>User stories should be written collaboratively usually when the user story is being groomed</li>
<li>A user story should not be confused with a task. A task represents &ldquo;how&rdquo;, a user story represents &ldquo;why&rdquo;</li>
