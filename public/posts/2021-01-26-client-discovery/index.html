<main>
<p><strong>Pre Client Discovery process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get a small write up from the concerned stakeholder defining what is needed/expected out of the call</li>
<li>Check the preposition offered
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s being offered to the client?</li>
<li>What are some pros and cons of the offering?</li>
<li>Whats the expected outcome and output?</li>
<li>What are some of the competitors?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the usp of the solution implemented by major competitors?</li>
<li>Confirm if the client has done some sort of similar task earlier.</li>
<li>How will you document and share the outcomes of the discussion?</li>
<li>How many people will be involved (project team members and client stakeholders?)How will we engage and inform the stakeholders?</li>
<li>How long will the project take to complete? How complex is the work?How well defined are the project scope and requirements?</li>
<li>Are there any risks and unknowns that need further exploration?</li>
<li>How much effort is needed for research, client sessions and internal planning?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the decision maker and decision enabler?</li>
<li>For whom the project is to be created?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During Client Discovery Process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify Client&rsquo;s goals and objectives</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the current state?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the expected state of the same system?</li>
<li>Technical expectations
<ul>
<li>Which technology is being used at client&rsquo;s end?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the uptime required?</li>
<li>Is there a requirement of any third party support?</li>
<li>Are there any technical roadblocks (Client expectation is that a release to be done every alternate week but technology dictates release in every 2 months)</li>
<li>Define Technology relevant constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Product Perspective
<ul>
<li>For whom we are creating this product?</li>
<li>Who is the end user?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the fundamental need we are solving with the product? Try to revolve the product around this need. (For example, if the product is based around vaccination then the product should signify safety and security of the end user. This can be enabled by using helpful images/quotes in and around load screen, app design by large should reflect be user friendly etc.)</li>
<li>Define the outcome and the output? (For example, the output for the above example could be to create an app which facilitates scheduling and monitoring of vaccination, the outcome could be to increase user satisfaction and to make user&rsquo;s comfortable while undergoing vaccination program)</li>
<li>Define possible negative scenario for the project (For eg. If implementing one feature affects the other business stream)</li>
<li>In case there are different goals, establishing a priority order for those goals is essential</li>
<li>Define the product relevant constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Useful Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything</li>
<li>If possible, record the sessions</li>
<li>Funnelize the logical flow of each discovery session. Start with why and end with how</li>
<li>Use breaks in long interview session</li>
<li>Create good environment</li>
<li>Create a list of sample questions, which can act as a guide</li>
<li>Keep the conversation flowing</li>
<li>Build rapport with the interviewee</li>
<li>Followup question to be asked</li>
<li>Closed ended question to be kept to minimum</li>
<li>Focus on “why” type of questions</li>
</ul>
