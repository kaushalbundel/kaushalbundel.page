<p>Jevons Paradox implies that in the long term, an increase in efficiency in the resource usage will generate an increase in resource consumption rather than a decrease ([^1]: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00026/full">Unraveling the Complexity of the Jevons Paradox: The Link Between Innovation, Efficiency, and Sustainability</a>).</p>
<p>Jevons Paradox is a term conceived in economics by English economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book &ldquo;The Coal Question&rdquo;. Jevons observed that England&rsquo;s coal consumption increased after James Watt introduced new efficient steam engine, though by all means the coal consumption should have decreased as a result of higher efficiency of coal powered engines.</p>
<p>What makes Jevons Paradox interesting that it is counter intuitive in nature with numerous examples all around us. Some of the examples that I can think of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Technology:The technology usage should decrease with better hardware usage but in reality the result is quite the</li>
<li>In electricity usage: With efficient modes of electricity generation and distribution, the electricity usage per capita  has also increased.</li>
<li>In automobile usage: With higher number of  fuel efficient cars, the av. distance travelled has increased (Similar to the long distance travelled by Aeroplanes).</li>
