      <description>Jevons Paradox implies that in the long term, an increase in efficiency in the resource usage will generate an increase in resource consumption rather than a decrease ([^1]: Unraveling the Complexity of the Jevons Paradox: The Link Between Innovation, Efficiency, and Sustainability).
Jevons Paradox is a term conceived in economics by English economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book &amp;ldquo;The Coal Question&amp;rdquo;.
