      <description>I am Kaushal Bundel. I live in Jaipur, Rajasthan (India) with loving, caring parents, a wonderful wife and super energetic daughter. My story started with loving Comics, Books and Computers. Though Computers were a treat to play with, I detested programming and related works. I enjoyed creating small games, running &amp;ldquo;Kid&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Olympics with me and my 3 other friends and creating short stories.
I did my engineering staying as far as Computers as I can.</description>
