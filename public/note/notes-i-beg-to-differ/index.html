<p>In Investing world, to earn above than average return you need to be different. This means doing things, thinking things in a manner which other people are not doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform. If you hope to distinguish yourself in terms of performance, you have to depart from the pack. But, having departed, the difference will only be positive if your choice of strategies and tactics in correct and/or you are able to execute better.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Develop second level thinking</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Basic Idea behind second level thinking: In order to outperform, your thinking has to be different and better.</li>
</ul>
<p>***Note to self: I am involve in knowledge work in direct competition with millions of people across the globe, if I am going to think like the rest of these people I am going to get the same result like them, I order to grow and be better I need to think different and execute in a manner which 1. Represents me in a way that is very unique to me 2. Move me away from the herd of people. ***</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quote: In order to outperform, your thinking has to be different and better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, your goal in investing isn’t to earn average returns; you want to do better than average. Thus, your thinking has to be better than that of others – both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well informed and highly computerized, you must find an edge they don’t have. You must think of something they haven’t thought of, see things they miss, or bring insight they don’t possess. You have to react differently and behave differently. In short, being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won’t be sufficient. You have to be more right than others . . . which by definition means your thinking has to be different.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the characteristics of second order thinking?
<ul>
<li>The second order thinking is deep, complex and convoluted. It is not lazy think like the first order thinking is.</li>
<li>The second order thinking takes time. One can not able to think (atleast during the start of the process) second order effects with regularity. One has to stop, weigh all the options, think about related processes, think about systems and the constituents that make this space. Think about the past and the future. A simple example of second order thinking from a finance perspective is as mentioned below:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The second-level thinker takes a great many things into account:
What is the range of likely future outcomes?
What outcome do I think will occur?
What’s the probability I’m right?
What does the consensus think?
How does my expectation differ from the consensus?
How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the
future, and with mine?
Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?
What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and
what if I’m right?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Think about Contrarianism</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is defined as being different from the herd</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note to Self: Understanding that even though the individuals and group of people behave in a different manner. People are influenced and affected by mass euphoria and loose the ability to think for themselves. This is evident in the case of mass hysteria associated with the start up community. We generally perceive start up community as a bunch of above intelligent, networked people that have complete understanding of how the world is supposed to work. But these start up frequently undergo cycles of boom and bust. Hence try to be as rationale as one can</strong></em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Decision to Risk being wrong</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The decision to being different is prone to being wrong. The path to being different is the path to move away from being average. Average is the most safe place to be. Not necessarily a bad place but not a a place for doing great things.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Most great investments begin in discomfort. The things most people feel good about –investments where the underlying premise is widely accepted, the recent performance has been positive, and the outlook is rosy – are unlikely to be available at bargain prices. Rather, bargains are usually found among things that are controversial, that people are pessimistic about, and that have been performing badly of late.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example from a financial standpoint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a market that is even moderately efficient, everything you do to depart from the consensus in pursuit of above average returns has the potential to result in below average returns if your departure turns out to be a mistake. Overweighting something versus underweighting it; concentrating versus diversifying; holding versus selling; hedging versus not hedging – these are all double-edged swords. You gain when you make the right choice and lose when you’re wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Last bit of advice:
Unconventional behavior is the only road to superior investment results, but it isn’t
for everyone. In addition to superior skill, successful investing requires the ability
to look wrong for a while and survive some mistakes. Thus each person has to assess
whether he’s temperamentally equipped to do these things and whether his circumstances
– in terms of employers, clients and the impact of other people’s opinions – will allow it
. . . when the chips are down and the early going makes him look wrong, as it invariably
will.</em>*</p>
