<p>I am Kaushal Bundel. I live in Jaipur, Rajasthan (India) with loving, caring parents, a wonderful wife and super energetic daughter. My story started with loving <a href="https://rajcomics.shop/">Comics</a>, Books and Computers. Though Computers were a treat to play with, I detested programming and related works. I enjoyed creating small games, running &ldquo;Kid&rsquo;s&rdquo; Olympics with me and my 3 other friends and creating short stories.</p>
<p>I did my engineering staying as far as Computers as I can. I even did MBA from <a href="https://doms.iitm.ac.in/">DoMS, IIT Madras</a> just to stay far away from all computer related work that was the compulsion of fresh graduates in India. My first job was with Daimler India Commercial Vehicles as a Purchase Manager. This was my first job, I made a lot of mistakes, learned a lot and tried to figure out what do I really want from the life. I understood a could of things, I <strong>loved creating</strong> and <strong>being a part of something meaningful</strong> and I loved <strong>playing with Computers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Time to start again</strong></p>
<p>I was far from intention by quite a long distance. The period was startup boom and to sharpen my computer programmming and analytical skills I joined <a href="https://www.cardekho.com/">CarDekho.com</a>. I made some awesome friendships and learnt the trade of Business Analysis and Product Management. During that time, I started writing small scripts in Python and SQL to make my life bit easier. The company was on upward trajectory and the work ran 24 x 7 x 365. At this time, I dabbed in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as well. I took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction">Machine Learning Specialization- Coursera</a> by <a href="https://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> and <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning</a> by <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Jeremy Howard</a>. Both of these courses left an impression on me and made me realize the impact that computers/internet and AI will have on the world around us.</p>
<p>To learn more, I went to my next organization <a href="https://www.mtxb2b.com/s/">MTX</a>. I worked in a client facing business analyst role. This job enabled me to learn creating products that customer&rsquo;s love and adore. We created software that impacted crucial functions and millions of users enabling <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-launches-new-voter-registration-system-to-speed-election-work/D4ONSIYTMNDS5IKJSL4FBOZUMA/">Voter Registration in Georgia</a> and Georgia Childcare Facilities.</p>
<p>Even though the work was enjoyable and I was learning everyday, I felt I was far from the actual product creation. On the top of that I had a health scare that prompted me to reassess my priorities at the time.</p>
<p>I understood hat if I wanted to build products that users love I need to understand how these products are being built, which meant learning coding and creating projects.</p>
<p><strong>Time to start again&hellip; again</strong></p>
<p>This brings us to today and to my goals for the near foreseeable future..</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learning the basics of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">web development</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create</strong> a product that has to be <strong>marketed</strong> and eventually <strong>sold</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the meantime, maintain a balance between work and life</p>
