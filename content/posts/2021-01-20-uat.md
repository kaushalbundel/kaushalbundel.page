**What is UAT?**

UAT is User Acceptance testing. Essentially it is a testing performed by the end user/client before moving the software application to the production environment.

**What's the need of UAT?**

- capture the requirement in a direct and verifiable manner
- identify problems which unit/integration tests might have missed
- tells how "done" the system is

**Steps to do an effective UAT**
1. Plan the UAT
2. Preparation of the test data, scenarios and test environment
3. UAT test scheduling and management
4. UAT testing execution and issue management
5. Testing signoff and reporting

**Types of UAT**

<u>Alpha Testing</u>

- takes place in development environment
- usually done by internal staff, before product is released by external users/clients

<u>Beta Testing</u>

- takes place in customers environment

<u>Regulation Acceptance Testing</u>

- testing for Compliance
- test if the software is compatible with rules and regulations set by government/regulatory agencies

<u>Contract Acceptance Testing</u>

- test against the specifics mentioned in the contract

<u>Operational Acceptance Testing</u>
