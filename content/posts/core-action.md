## What is core action?

Core Action for any product is the central theme of the product. It is the action performed by the user that will provide maximum utility the product has to offer. Once the user has performed this step repeatedly and successfully, one can be sure that the user understands the product and is comfortable in using the product.

## Why is core action important?

Successful core action signifies that the user has derived major utility the product is offering. Repeat core action signifies that the product model is synced with the user's mental model and the user would continue to use the product. Core Action becomes crucial from the point of view of NUX(New User Experience). The user onboarding process suffers immensely when the expected core action is not explicit to the new user.

## What is an example of Core Action?

Facebook: Facebook offers a lots of functions, like Profile creation, Timeline, Posting, Chat etc. But in my view the core action for Facebook is to "Send Friend Request". Once the user has Sent Friend Request, then the algorithm can bring relevant content to the user and the user will be engaged with the product.
