## Book Summary {#book-summary}

Simplistically, This book talks about the journey of an old man in the sea and his efforts to catch a fish. On a deeper level, The book is an allegory of what it means to pursue something. The sea is the vast expense of the world, where one should not venture too far. The huge, deep part of the sea is unpredictable with all manner of dangers like Sharks and unstable sea.

Given the circumstances are harsh and there is a perennial absence of resources one should not venture too far and should stick to oneâ€™s routine. Still, the existential angst pushes the old man "Santiago" to go exactly the opposite of that and he sails far and long in the sea in search of fish. The boat is a small _skiff_ and there are limited supplies. But the Old Man decides to go on and on in search of something unknown but substantial.

He gets many small fish in the middle but he continues his pursuit in search of more.  He even catches a couple of small fishes and a small dolphin but he continues to go for more. Towards, the deepest end the man suddenly catches a great, big fish. A fish that is strong, powerful and elegant in all aspects of a great fish.

This great fish brings a bigger challenge to keep a hold of the fish due to its large size and immense speed. The fish pulls the Old Man towards the deepest end of the Ocean. The Man exhibits immense strength and patience worthy of the big fish but is unable to deal a killer blow and bring the fish onboard.

After many days, far from home, hungry and deprived of energy, the man finally deals a killer blow to the great fish. He tries to bring the fish to the little _skiff_ but is unable to as the fish is too big to load up. The dead fish and the smell of blood draw many Sharks, the man tries to hold on to the big fish, fighting with all his might to preserve and respect the big fish he has just killed.

The contest between the man and the sharks goes on. He kills many a Sharks and the Sharks exact the same onto the fish, devouring the once great fish bite after bite. The old man struggles to find a way to carry this great fish but somehow reaches the shore of his town, tired, bitten, hungry and with a shadow of the great struggle between him and the fish and the Sharks.


## My Thoughts and Interpretation {#my-thoughts-and-interpretation}

The story being an allegory is difficult to explain as it could mean different to different people. But I view this story as the broader route to do something that only a few people have done.

One would never be perfect or as youthful as she once was.
One would have to go to the deeper end where the rewards will be high but challenges will be unexpected and dangers will be immense.
One would always have fewer resources than needed and would always think that she should have packed more.
One will think of good times many times over during the ordeal and will pray to the higher gods to save her.
One would encounter dangers when she will be at her lowest and rewards when she will be least expecting them.
One would be lucky if she could tell the tale of her adventures alive.

In the end, the journey will give its reward with a deep peaceful sleep.
