I am Kaushal Bundel. I live in Jaipur, Rajasthan (India) with loving, caring parents, a wonderful wife and super energetic daughter. My story started with loving [Comics](https://rajcomics.shop/), Books and Computers. Though Computers were a treat to play with, I detested programming and related works. I enjoyed creating small games, running "Kid's" Olympics with me and my 3 other friends and creating short stories.

 I did my engineering staying as far as Computers as I can. I even did MBA from [DoMS, IIT Madras](https://doms.iitm.ac.in/) just to stay far away from all computer related work that was the compulsion of fresh graduates in India. My first job was with Daimler India Commercial Vehicles as a Purchase Manager. This was my first job, I made a lot of mistakes, learned a lot and tried to figure out what do I really want from the life. I understood a could of things, I **loved creating** and **being a part of something meaningful** and I loved **playing with Computers**.  

**Time to start again**

I was far from intention by quite a long distance. The period was startup boom and to sharpen my computer programmming and analytical skills I joined [CarDekho.com](https://www.cardekho.com/). I made some awesome friendships and learnt the trade of Business Analysis and Product Management. During that time, I started writing small scripts in Python and SQL to make my life bit easier. The company was on upward trajectory and the work ran 24 x 7 x 365. At this time, I dabbed in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as well. I took the [Machine Learning Specialization- Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) and [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/) by [Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/). Both of these courses left an impression on me and made me realize the impact that computers/internet and AI will have on the world around us. 

To learn more, I went to my next organization [MTX](https://www.mtxb2b.com/s/). I worked in a client facing business analyst role. This job enabled me to learn creating products that customer's love and adore. We created software that impacted crucial functions and millions of users enabling [Voter Registration in Georgia](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-launches-new-voter-registration-system-to-speed-election-work/D4ONSIYTMNDS5IKJSL4FBOZUMA/) and Georgia Childcare Facilities. 

Even though the work was enjoyable and I was learning everyday, I felt I was far from the actual product creation. On the top of that I had a health scare that prompted me to reassess my priorities at the time.  

I understood hat if I wanted to build products that users love I need to understand how these products are being built, which meant learning coding and creating projects. 

**Time to start again... again**

This brings us to today and to my goals for the near foreseeable future..

1. Learning the basics of [web development](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

2. **Create** a product that has to be **marketed** and eventually **sold**

3. In the meantime, maintain a balance between work and life
