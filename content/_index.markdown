# Kaushal Bundel

Hello, This is a space to share my thoughts and experiments over world wide web. It solves couple of selfish purposes. I am learning to write in public and this blog gives me a tiny window to the world from where I can project and practice. Second, I need to have a space where I can write down and access stuff at my own convenience and what's better than this space. 

If you are not me, then you can also take benefits of my mistakes and learn not to repeat them. 

If you want to know more [about me](/content/about.md). 

I can be contacted at <kaushalbundel@gmail.com>.
