# Kaushal Bundel

Hello, This is a space to share my thoughts and experiments over world wide web. It solves couple of selfish purposes. I am learning to write in public and this blog gives me a tiny window to the world from where I can project and practice. Second, I need to have a space where I can write down and access stuff at my own convinience and what's better than this space. 

If you are not me, then you can also take benefits of my mistakes and learn not to repeat them. 

If you want to know more [about me](/content/about.md). 

I can be contacted at <kaushalbundel@gmail.com>.

**Why Blog?**

1. In the time and age of Facebook, Twitter(or shall I say _X_) and (_god forbid_) Instagram why to take the effort and maintain something of your own?

Social Media is nothing but addiction and like an insane junkie I want out. I was on the _good stuff_ from the days of Orkut and have seen this space evolve over the years. Its safe to say that today's internet is filled with trackers, shiny lights and mindbending algorithms that take not only your mental bandwidth but the thinking ability one posses. 
Though, I am not fully recovered but I am slowly trying to standup against it. 

2. Why not existing online platforms like, Substack and Medium?

I am not trying to monetize myself _yet_ :face_with_peeking_eye:
I am trying to keep my blog personal and free of all external events and circumstances. There are a lot of situations which could happen with a company (_read_ X) that will make the platform unusable. I am not willing to take the hassle of migrating to yet another "new" platform.

**Why is this Blog so plain?**

1. I am greatly impressed by this awesome article [The small web is beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/) by Ben Hoyt. To summerize: small web is portable, easy to maintain has fewer dependencies and so on. 

Also, by no means this site is _small_ but its a start in the right direction. Overtime the goal would be to chip few peices out and make it even leaner.

2. The website is created using [HUGO - A very fast static website generator](https://gohugo.io/). The theme that I have chosen is a excellent lightweight theme called [Hugo XMIN](https://xmin.yihui.org/). A quote from the author of the theme, to explain the theme.


> ## _Keep it simple, but not simpler_
>
> **XMin** is a Hugo theme written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org) in about four hours: half an hour was spent on the Hugo templates, and 3.5 hours were spent on styling. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal example to beginners of Hugo templates. This XMin theme contains about 130 lines of code in total, including the code in HTML templates and CSS (also counting empty lines).


3. I intend to keep this website very simple to use for me and keeping it plain text base with simple formatting is the way forward.
