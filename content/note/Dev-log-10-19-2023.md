# Completed Tasks 

- Started Learning Flutter and Dart from the Udemy Course along with miscellaneous readings 
- Completed the first section of the course
  
  - Objective: Create a flutter project to simulate Dice ie. as a button on the screen is clicked the UI changes randomly and a new number is shown on the app UI
  - Project Link: [Github Project: Dice Simulation](https://github.com/kaushalbundel/flutter-projects/tree/main/practice_project "Github Project Link")
  
# Concepts learnt

- How Dart Works?

    - [Freecodecamp - An Introduction to Dart](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/https-medium-com-rahman-sameeha-whats-flutter-an-intro-to-dart-6fc42ba7c4a3/)

- Significance of "const" keyword

    - "const" keyword is used for performance improvement in Flutter. When used before a object (Widget), the object is cached in the memory, thereby making it easier to access when need.
    - [Stackoverflow - "const" vs "final"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50431055/what-is-the-difference-between-the-const-and-final-keywords-in-dart)
    
- Variable declaration in Dart

    - Coming from the Python, the variable declaration is bit complicated in Dart. Though I have not mapped my head around the variable declaration as yet, but still they way things are done are "interesting" to say at least.
    - [Variables - Official Flutter Documentation](https://dart.dev/language/variables)
    
- "this" keyword in Dart

    - This is just like how "self" is used in Python. "self" is used to refer value for the specific class instance, "this" does the same thing in Dart.
    - [Stackoverflow - Usage of "this" keyword in Dart](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64324559/what-does-mean-of-using-the-this-keyword-in-dart)
    
- Stateful vs Stateless Widgets

    - "State" in simplistic terms refers to the changes done in the UI
    - Stateful essentially means that widget can be programmed to change the UI of the app, this behaviour does not work in the case of "Stateless" widget
    - [Stackoverflow - Stateful vs Stateless Widget](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71293508/stateful-widget-inside-a-stateless-widget-and-vice-versa)
